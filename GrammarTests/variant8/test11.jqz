<reading-text>&amp;#x003C;b&amp;#x003E;&amp;#x003C;Font color=&quot;#cc0033&quot;&amp;#x003E;I.&amp;#x003C;/Font&amp;#x003E; They call Jamaica the &apos;Island in the Sun&apos;, and that is my memory of it. Of sunshine, warmth and abundant fruit growing everywhere, and of love. I was born on 2 April 1960 in St. Andrews in Kingston. There were two sisters ahead of me in the family, and though of course I didn&apos;t know it, there was
excited talk of emigration, possibly to Canada but more usually to England, the land of &amp;#x003C;Font color=&quot;#cc0033&quot;&amp;#x003E;opportunity&amp;#x003C;/Font&amp;#x003E;. I guess that plans were already being made when I was born, for a year or so later my Dad left for London. Two years after that, when he had saved enough money, my Mum went as well and my sisters and I were left in the care of my grandmother. I stayed with her, in her house near the centre of Kingston, until I was seven years old. My grandmother, therefore, shaped my life, and I believe I am all the better for it.
&amp;#x003C;Font color=&quot;#cc0033&quot;&amp;#x003E;II.&amp;#x003C;/Font&amp;#x003E; This was all fairly normal. Emigrating to better yourself was a dream for most Jamaicans, a dream many were determined to fulfill. Families were close and grandmothers were an important part of family life so, when the mass emigration began, it seemed perfectly right and natural for them to take over the running of the families left behind. After all, they had the experience. Grandmothers are often strict, but they usually also spoil you. At least, that is the way it was with mine. She ran the family like a military operation: each of us, no matter how young, had our tasks.
&amp;#x003C;Font color=&quot;#cc0033&quot;&amp;#x003E;III.&amp;#x003C;/Font&amp;#x003E; My Dad came over from England to see how we were getting on. I hadn&apos;t known him when he had left for Britain, but when I saw him I somehow knew that he was my father. He talked to us about the new country, about snow, about the huge city, and we all wanted to know more, to see what it was like. He also told me that I now had a younger brother, which made me feel excited and wonder what he could be like. I didn&apos;t know it at the time, but he had come to prepare us for the move to England. Six months later my grandmother told me that I was going to join my parents and that she, too, was emigrating. It was the end of my time in the Caribbean, of the &amp;#x003C;Font color=&quot;#cc0033&quot;&amp;#x003E;sheltered&amp;#x003C;/Font&amp;#x003E;, warm, family life that I had known there, and the beginning of a new and exciting era.
&amp;#x003C;Font color=&quot;#cc0033&quot;&amp;#x003E;IV.&amp;#x003C;/Font&amp;#x003E; London was strange and disappointing. There was no gold on the pavements, as the stories in Jamaica had indicated. Back home it had always been warm. Everyone was friendly and said &apos;Hello&apos; when you passed by on the street; in Kingston you knew everybody and they knew you. Here, it wasn&apos;t like that. The roads were busy, the buildings were grey and dull, with many tall, high-rise blocks. It was totally unlike Jamaica, the houses all small and packed close together. In my grandmother&apos;s house I had a big bedroom; here I had to share. At that age it was a great disappointment.
&amp;#x003C;Font color=&quot;#cc0033&quot;&amp;#x003E;V.&amp;#x003C;/Font&amp;#x003E; Worse was to come, because there followed a very cold winter, and I had never felt cold in my life before. Then came the biggest shock: snow. White flakes came out of the sky and Dad smiled, pointed and said, That&apos;s snow!&apos; I rushed outside, looked up and opened my mouth to let the flakes drop in. The snow settled on my tongue and it was so cold that I cried. My toes lost all feeling, and at the primary school that we attended I wasn&apos;t allowed to wear long trousers at my age. The teachers made us go out to play in the playground and I joined in with all the fun, sliding around in the snow, throwing snowballs, all the usual things. Suddenly, as my shoes and socks got soaking wet and frozen, there came a terrible pain and I cried with the intensity of it. I didn&apos;t know what was happening to me.
